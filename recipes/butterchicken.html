        <li>1 teaspoon Ground Cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>To finish</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces butter cut into cubes, (use coconut oil if dairy free)</li>
        <li>4 ounces Heavy Cream, (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free)</li>

        <li>1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <h4>Instant Pot instructions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better</li>
        <li>Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. </li>
        <li>Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside</li>
        <li>Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender</li>
        <li>Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon</li>
        <li>Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Using leftover sauce</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro on top.</li>
        <li>You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go.</li>
    </ol>
